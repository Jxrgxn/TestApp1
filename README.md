# TestApp1
App designed to demonstrate the importance of proper delegate and protocol architecture in Swift.

This was a simple app I built for my blog at garglingwithrazorblades.com to demonstrate the importance of proper delegate and protocol architecture. 
I would consider this to be best practice as it decouples the code in an elegant way. 

I also demonstrate the proper use of extensions.
